# Brain Tumor Classification using MRI Images

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify brain tumors into three categories—Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary—using MRI images. The classification model employs Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for feature extraction and XGBoost for classification. The goal is to explore the potential of GLCM feature extraction techniques in enhancing medical image analysis.

## Project Description
Brain tumors are classified into different types based on their origin and characteristics. Accurate classification of these tumors is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan. This project uses MRI images and focuses on the following:

**Feature Extraction**: Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is used to extract texture features from MRI images.
**Classification**: XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, is employed to classify the tumors based on the extracted features.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of MRI images labeled into three categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
The images are preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
## Libraries:
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Scikit-Learn for machine learning utilities
- XGBoost for classification
- Matplotlib for data visualization
